# Computer-Science-paper-LSH


This project implements Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to efficiently detect duplicate products in a dataset of TV product listings. It also evaluates the performance of LSH-based duplicate detection using various metrics like pair completeness, pair quality, and the F1 score.

The project contains two primary scripts:

Code 1: Runs LSH and evaluates performance without MSM.
Code 2: Runs LSH combined with Min-Hashing and Multi-Stage Matching (MSM) for duplicate detection and evaluation.

The dataset used in this project is a JSON file containing TV product information from different online shops.
